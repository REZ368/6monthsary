Dear Mary,

Happy 6-monthsary, baby.

It has really been a long journey since we started. From the first month of October, you gave me so much attention and love, and I truly appreciated that. That was when I started falling in love with you. From that first month, you were like the sun in a dark night. I was not very affectionate before, but my love for you was real. I wanted to meet you so badly. <br><br>

You were the girl I had a crush on because of your beauty, your smile, your eyes, your personality, and the way you share your days, your friends, and your life. You are pleasing, lovely, and sweet. I may not have much to give, but I can give you my loyalty, love, honor, care, and trust.<br><br>
 
I didn’t realize how we were slowly gaining more and more memories together. I am very thankful that you met me, and I also kind of regret that you saw my bad side. But instead of leaving, you stayed. You stayed even when I was very busy before and ended up ignoring you because of my work. Still, that did not stop you from staying with me. I was blind not to notice that before.<br><br>

I am thankful because even when you were so obsessed with me before, I failed to appreciate it. I am sorry for being too busy with work. I was motivated at that time because you were my purpose for working. You were the reason I slowly started becoming myself again. I am not really a good person, but I didn’t realize that you would be the reason I became kinder to people, even when I receive nothing in return.<br><br>

You are the reason I started taking myself seriously, working harder, praying harder, and loving you deeply. Yes, I am a yearner, and that is because you showed me what life and home feel like. You are the home I want to stay in and live in forever. I want to be with you badly, to be close, free, and even freaky together anytime.<br><br>

I’m sorry for my attitude. I am an overthinker, and sometimes I cannot control my mind because I am afraid of my past self. I want to love you, not leave you. I want to care for you, not abandon you. I used to be avoidant, but I changed because I wanted to prove myself to you and give you assurance and commitment.<br><br>

But honestly, I don’t know what to do right now. I am at my lowest point. I don’t have anyone to talk to or share things with. I even ignored my friends because I was focused on finding solutions. What matters most to me right now is saving money and keeping you.<br><br>

But you are busy too, so I slowly started giving you less attention so you could focus more on your life without me. And that is exactly what I am afraid of. I am afraid that you will leave me. I don’t want to feel that pain and cry again. It would really hurt me if you left me or cheated on me.<br><br>

Your friends might be right. Maybe you are not ready for a relationship. Maybe they are right that you are into flirting and not growing old with me. I don’t have the right to tell them they are wrong because they are your friends, and I respect that boundary. I honestly don’t know what to do. Maybe they are right. Maybe you should leave me, even though I am scared of that. I feel powerless.<br><br>

If flirting is all you want from this relationship, then maybe I am not the one for you. I want to grow old with you, make you my wife, and build our dreams together. I am into a long-term relationship because I am getting older, and I chose you. Please wait for me. I am still struggling.<br><br>

But hey, baby… guess what? We reached our 6th monthsary. I hope we continue to be together until the day we finally say the word “Finally.” Finally, we meet. Finally, we date.<br><br>

Thank you for the memories. <br>
Thank you for loving me.<br>
Thank you for accepting me.<br>
Thank you for understanding me.<br>
Thank you for the care.<br>
Thank you for the flirts.<br>
Thank you for the voice calls.<br>
Thank you for the freakiness.<br>
Thank you for the motivation.<br>
Thank you for the games we played.<br>
See you at the aisle.<br><br>

Thank you, Micah.<br>
I did love you.<br><br>

Sincerly Yours,<br>
Renz Kayle Ando<br>
